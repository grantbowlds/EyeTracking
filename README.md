# EyeTracking
A Unity project that was to be used at the Living in Virtual Environments Lab at Vanderbilt University. Most of the interesting code is in the main level where there is an integration with Varjo's eye camera SDK that produces gaze-object intersections and timestamps as a CSV. This is an old project that needs updates and documentation to be interesting again. Regardless, feel free to contact grantbowlds@gmail.com with any questions.
